Hello my name is Valerie Hayden I go by she/her, I am a self taught web developer/programmer with experience in game design. I current work with projects in C#, java, and javascript in the hopes of becoming a software engineer. I first started learning how to code during my junior year of high school with my first website being made in HTML. After that I got interested in looking at the source code of projects to see how they were developed. Now I am interested in learning new workflows and technologies in the hopes of becoming a better developer
