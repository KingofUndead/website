Hello, my name is Valerie Hayden. My preferred pronouns are she/her. I am a self taught web developer and programmer with experience in game design. I currently work with projects in C#, java, and javascript with the aspirations of becoming a software engineer. I began to code my junior year of high school, and got interested in looking at the source code of projects to see how they were developed. Using what I learned, I made my first website in HTML. Currently, I am interested in learning new workflows and technologies in the hopes of becoming a better developer
