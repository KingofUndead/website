<div><p>My name is King_of_Undead and I am currently majoring in video game design at Western Iowa Tech</p></div>
<div><p>If you're wondering why does this website look like this and the answer is because it wasn't made by a website builder it was made with Code</p></div>
<div><p>So i can change the website background to what other color i want</p></div>
<div>So thank you for stopping by</div>
<div><p>The sentence above is a short cut please don't take short cuts for coding because it doesn't have the paragraph code</p></div>
<div><p>it's easy to take short cuts but they aren't something you should do like highlighting something in excel when excel is supposed to do it</p></div>
<div><p>So please don't type text</p></div> 
  <div><div><div><div><p> changes will be made to this and other pages of the website</p></div></div></div></div>
